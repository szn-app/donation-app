To implement authorization in a webapp using **Ory Keto** (a Zanzibar-style authorization system) for managing community groups and their admins, you need to model the authorization relationships in Keto's tuple-based graph while leveraging your SQL database for application-specific data. Below, I outline how to approach this, addressing your question about whether to use additional SQL tables (e.g., `management` and `management_membership`) or rely entirely on Keto's graph for authorization.

### Key Concepts
1. **Ory Keto's Role**: Keto handles **authorization checks** using a tuple-based relationship graph. It stores relationships like "who is an admin of a group" or "who is a member of a group" as tuples (e.g., `group:group_id#admin@user:user_id`).

2. **SQL Database Role**: The SQL database typically stores application data (e.g., group metadata, user profiles, and potentially membership or management records for easier querying or business logic). However, **authorization decisions** (e.g., "Can this user manage the group?") should be delegated to Keto.

3. **Zanzibar Model**: Zanzibar (and Keto) uses a graph-based model where permissions are derived by traversing relationships. For example:
   - A user is an admin if they have a direct `admin` relation to a group.
   - Permissions (e.g., `manage`) can be checked by defining rules in Keto's namespace configuration.

### Authorization Implementation

#### 1. Modeling Relationships in Keto
You can model community groups, memberships, and admin privileges directly in Keto using namespaces and relation tuples. Here's an example setup:

- **Namespace Definition**: Define a namespace for `community_group` in Keto's configuration (e.g., via Keto's API or configuration file).
  ```yaml
  namespaces:
    - name: community_group
      relations:
        - name: member
        - name: admin
        - name: manage
          # Define how "manage" permission is computed
          subjects:
            - relation: admin
  ```

- **Relation Tuples**:
  - **Membership**: To indicate a user is a member of a group:
    ```
    community_group:group_123#member@user:user_456
    ```
  - **Admin**: To indicate a user is an admin of a group:
    ```
    community_group:group_123#admin@user:user_789
    ```
  - **Manage Permission**: The `manage` relation is computed based on the `admin` relation (as defined in the namespace). For example, if `user_789` is an admin, Keto automatically infers:
    ```
    community_group:group_123#manage@user:user_789
    ```

- **Authorization Checks**:
  - To check if a user can manage a group, query Keto's **Check API**:
    ```
    GET /relation-tuples/check?namespace=community_group&object=group_123&relation=manage&subject_id=user_789
    ```
    Keto responds with whether the user has the `manage` permission based on the graph traversal.

#### 2. SQL Database Design
The SQL database should store **application data** (e.g., group names, descriptions, creation dates) and, optionally, **redundant membership/admin data** for performance or business logic. However, **authorization decisions** should always be validated by Keto.

- **Minimal SQL Schema**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE community_groups (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      description TEXT,
      created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  );

  CREATE TABLE community_memberships (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
      group_id UUID REFERENCES community_groups(id),
      user_id UUID NOT NULL,
      role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- e.g., 'member', 'admin'
      created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
      UNIQUE(group_id, user_id)
  );
  ```
  - The `community_memberships` table stores both members and admins, with a `role` column to distinguish them.
  - This table is optional for authorization but useful for:
    - Querying group members/admins in the app (e.g., displaying a list of admins).
    - Syncing with Keto (e.g., when a user is added as an admin, update both SQL and Keto).

- **Avoid Separate Management Tables**:
  You **do not need** a separate `management` or `management_membership` table unless your application has complex management-specific metadata (e.g., admin-specific settings or permissions beyond what Keto handles). Instead:
  - Use the `community_memberships` table with a `role` column to track admins.
  - Store authorization relationships (e.g., who is an admin) in Keto's graph.
  - This keeps the SQL schema simple and avoids duplicating authorization logic.

#### 3. Workflow for Group Management
Hereâ€™s how the system handles common operations:

- **Creating a Group**:
  1. Create a record in `community_groups` (SQL).
  2. Add the creator as an admin in Keto:
     ```
     community_group:group_123#admin@user:creator_id
     ```
  3. Optionally, add the creator to `community_memberships` with `role='admin'`.

- **Adding an Admin**:
  1. An existing admin (verified via Keto's Check API) initiates the action.
  2. Add the new admin to Keto:
     ```
     community_group:group_123#admin@user:new_admin_id
     ```
  3. Optionally, update `community_memberships` with `role='admin'`.

- **Checking Management Privileges**:
  1. Query Keto to check if a user can manage the group:
     ```
     GET /relation-tuples/check?namespace=community_group&object=group_123&relation=manage&subject_id=user_789
     ```
  2. Optionally, use SQL to fetch additional metadata (e.g., group details) after authorization is confirmed.

- **Removing an Admin**:
  1. Verify the requester is an admin (via Keto).
  2. Delete the admin tuple from Keto:
     ```
     DELETE community_group:group_123#admin@user:admin_id
     ```
  3. Optionally, update or delete the corresponding `community_memberships` record.

#### 4. SQL vs. Keto for Authorization
- **Authorization in Keto**:
  - All **permission checks** (e.g., "Can this user manage the group?") should be handled by Keto.
  - Keto's graph is the **source of truth** for authorization relationships (e.g., who is an admin).
  - Benefits:
    - Scalable and flexible for complex permission models.
    - Centralized authorization logic, avoiding inconsistencies.
    - Supports hierarchical or computed permissions (e.g., `manage` derived from `admin`).

- **SQL for Redundancy**:
  - The `community_memberships` table can mirror Keto's data for convenience (e.g., listing admins in the UI).
  - However, **do not rely on SQL for authorization checks**, as this risks desynchronization with Keto's graph.
  - Sync SQL and Keto carefully:
    - When updating memberships or admin roles, update both SQL and Keto in a transaction.
    - Use eventual consistency (e.g., a background job) if immediate sync is not critical.

- **Why Avoid Separate Management Tables**:
  - A separate `management` or `management_membership` table is redundant unless you have management-specific metadata (e.g., admin-specific settings not handled by Keto).
  - Keto already encodes the admin relationship (`community_group:group_id#admin@user:user_id`), so duplicating this in SQL as a separate table adds complexity without clear benefits.
  - Instead, use a single `community_memberships` table with a `role` column to cover both members and admins.

### Recommendations
1. **Use Keto for All Authorization**:
   - Encode admin and member relationships in Keto's graph.
   - Define permissions (e.g., `manage`) in Keto's namespace configuration.
   - Use Keto's Check API for all authorization decisions.

2. **Minimal SQL Schema**:
   - Use `community_groups` for group metadata.
   - Use `community_memberships` with a `role` column for membership and admin data.
   - Avoid separate `management` or `management_membership` tables unless you have specific requirements (e.g., admin-specific metadata).

3. **Sync SQL and Keto**:
   - When adding/removing members or admins, update both SQL and Keto.
   - Use transactions or background jobs to ensure consistency.

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Cache frequent Keto checks (e.g., using Redis) to reduce latency, but invalidate the cache on changes.
   - Use SQL for non-authorization queries (e.g., listing group members) to reduce Keto load.

5. **Security**:
   - Always validate permissions via Keto before performing actions.
   - Avoid relying on SQL data for authorization to prevent bypass vulnerabilities.

### Example Flow
- **User Action**: User A wants to add User B as an admin for Group X.
  1. **Check Authorization**: Query Keto to confirm User A has `manage` permission for Group X.
  2. **Update Keto**: Add tuple `community_group:group_x#admin@user:b_id`.
  3. **Update SQL**: Insert/update `community_memberships` with `group_id=x`, `user_id=b_id`, `role='admin'`.
  4. **Response**: Notify the app of success.

By keeping authorization in Keto and using SQL for metadata and optional redundancy, you achieve a scalable, secure, and maintainable system.

### Final Answer
Authorization should be **fully encoded in Ory Keto's graph** using relation tuples (e.g., `community_group:group_id#admin@user:user_id`). The SQL database should store group metadata in `community_groups` and optionally track memberships/admins in a single `community_memberships` table with a `role` column. **Avoid separate `management` or `management_membership` tables** unless you have specific metadata requirements, as Keto already handles admin relationships. Sync SQL and Keto updates to maintain consistency, but always use Keto for authorization decisions.
